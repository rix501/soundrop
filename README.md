Getting Started
---------------

First install all dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```
This will install elm, electron and all deps needed for npm scripts to run and electron js to work.

Once you have that you can go ahead and start the Electron app with:
```bash
npm run build && npm run start
```

Developing
---------
```bash
npm run dev
```
This compiles elm, sass, starts watchers, and opens a browser tab with the app.
